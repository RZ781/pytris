# pytris
A simple stacker game implemented in Python.
You can play in the terminal, which has no dependencies, or in a GUI, which requires pygame to be installed.
The GUI version runs automatically as long as pygame is installed. To run the terminal version when pygame is installed, use --terminal.

Local multiplayer is supported. Start a server with --server, then join the game through multiplayer.
