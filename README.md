# pytris
A simple stacker game implemented in Python.

You can play in the terminal, which has no dependencies, or in a GUI, which requires pygame to be installed.
The GUI version runs automatically as long as pygame is installed. To force the terminal version to run, use `--terminal`.

To play multiplayer, start with `--address=<server ip>` and choose multiplayer.
If no address is specified, it will attempt to connect to a local server.
To start a server, start with `--server`.
