A server is started with ./main.py --server, and hosts one lobby. It listens on TCP port 51737.
Clients connect to localhost when opening a multiplayer game.

The protocol sends all integers as unsigned big endian integers. The client and server send messages to each other, consisting of a one byte command, 2 bytes length, and the actual data.
The client and server should both begin with a VERSION command, ensuring they are on the same version of the protocol (currently 0).

The following commands exist:
1 - SEND_GARBAGE - Client sends to server to say garbage has been sent. Data contains the number of lines sent.
2 - RECEIVE_GARBAGE - Server sends to client to say garbage has been received. Data contains the number of lines received.
